1. What is HTML ?
=>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the language used to create webpages. It structures the content on the page using tags, like headings, paragraphs, and images, making it possible for browsers to display text, links, and other elements properly.

2. Are the  HTML tags and elements the same thing ?
=>No, HTML tags and elements are not the same thing.

Tags are the code you write inside angle brackets, like <p> or </p>. They define the start and end of an HTML element.

Elements are the combination of the opening tag, content, and closing tag, like <p>This is a paragraph.</p>. An element represents the actual content on the page.
So, tags are part of an element, but an element includes the tags and everything between them.

3. What are the tags and attributes in HTMl ?
=>Tags are the building blocks of HTML. They define the elements on a webpage, like headings, paragraphs, images, links, tables, etc.
Most HTML tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The closing tag is similar to the opening tag but includes a forward slash (/) before the tag name.

* Common HTML Tags:-
<html>: Defines the root of an HTML document.
<head>: Contains meta-information about the document, like title, scripts, and styles.
<body>: Contains the content of the webpage, such as text, images, links, etc.
<h1> to <h6>: Headings, with <h1> being the highest level and <h6> the lowest.
<p>: Paragraph.
<a>: Anchor tag for links.
<img>: Image.
<div>: Division or section in a document.
<span>: Inline container for styling or grouping text.

Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are always included in the opening tag and are made up of a name and a value.
The value is enclosed in quotes, and it describes the behavior or property of the element.

* Common HTML Attributes :-
id: Uniquely identifies an element.
class: Specifies one or more class names for an element (used in CSS styling).
src: Specifies the source of an image, video, or other media.
alt: Provides alternative text for an image.
href: Specifies the URL of a link.
title: Provides additional information about an element (displayed as a tooltip).
style: Contains inline CSS styling rules.
data-*: Custom data attributes for embedding custom data in HTML elements.

4. What are void elements in HTML ?
=>Void elements in HTML are elements that do not have any content and do not require a closing tag. They are also known as self-closing elements. These elements are used to perform a specific function without enclosing any content, making them different from standard HTML tags that typically have both an opening and a closing tag.

* Characteristics of Void Elements :-

No closing tag: Void elements do not require a closing tag because they do not have any content to enclose.
Self-contained: They often serve a specific purpose, such as inserting images, line breaks, or metadata, without needing any additional content.
Common Void Elements in HTML
Here is a list of some of the most common void elements:

<area>: Defines an area inside an image map.
<base>: Specifies the base URL for relative URLs in the document.
<br>: Inserts a line break.
<col>: Specifies column properties for a table column group.
<embed>: Embeds external content like videos or plugins.
<hr>: Inserts a horizontal rule (a thematic break).
<img>: Embeds an image.
<input>: Creates an input field for forms.
<link>: Links to external resources like CSS files.
<meta>: Provides metadata about the HTML document.
<source>: Specifies multiple media resources for elements like <audio> or <video>.
<track>: Specifies text tracks for media elements like <video> or <audio>.
<wbr>: Suggests a line break opportunity in long words.

5. What is the feature of HTML ?
=>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. It provides a wide range of features that make it essential for building and presenting content on the internet. Here are some of the key features of HTML:

1. Structure of Web Pages
2. Hyperlinking Capabilities
3. Multimedia Integration
4. Form and Input Elements
5. Cross-Platform Compatibility
6. Semantic Elements
7. Support for CSS and JavaScript
8. Responsive Design
9. Easy to Learn and Use
10. Backward Compatibility

6. Diffrence bettween HTML vs XHTML ?
=>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and XHTML (Extensible HyperText Markup Language) are both languages used to create web pages, but they have some key differences in syntax, structure, and standards. Here's a comparison between the two:

HTML is a markup language used to structure web content.
It follows a loose set of rules, meaning it is more forgiving of errors in the code.
HTML 4.01 and HTML5 are the most commonly used versions.

XHTML is a stricter, XML-based version of HTML.
It adheres to the rules of XML (eXtensible Markup Language), meaning it is not as forgiving of coding errors.
XHTML 1.0 and XHTML 1.1 are the most common versions.
